The page is devoted to the analysis of the directions/places with the greatest losses of russian personnel 
and equipment presented from different perspectives.

The collection of data started since the 60th day of war, that is 2022-04-25 
and is automatically updated daily. Lots of fights are taking place at the war fronts every day.
Each record contains the directions/places with the greatest losses. 

Records could have multiple inputs that depend on fight losses amounts. 
For example, the directions Bakhmut and Donetsk were tracked on 2022-08-09. 
It means that one day before most russian losses were there. 
Donetsk does not mean the city Donetsk. It could be the road into the city or the countyside around. 
The same applies for other directions.

All charts are supported by hover texts.

**Timeline chart.** Each stick means a new day.

**Map.** Each circle is located in the closest city to the direction with the greatest losses. 
Even if the real front may be 50 km or farther away. 
The circle size depends on the number of days the greatest losses happened.

**Bar chart.** Each color shows a district of Ukraine  (oblast).
